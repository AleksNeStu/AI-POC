**GGUF (GPTQ-for-GGML Unified Format)** models are a compressed, quantized version of large language models (LLMs) designed to run efficiently on less powerful hardware, such as consumer-grade GPUs and CPUs. This format is particularly useful for deploying models like LLaMA, Mistral, or other large language models in environments where computational resources are limited.
