Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio.

These models can be applied on:

üìù Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation, in over 100 languages.
üñºÔ∏è Images, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
üó£Ô∏è Audio, for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.
